**Udemy Classes**

Udemy is a learning site where are classes are **PAID**. This site is not solely focused on iOS and has tons of courses for all sorts of things.

For the budget-minded person, I highly suggest you wait for sales on the courses you are interested in. They happen quite often and can save you a ton of money.

The projects in this repository are lessons that I am taking while learning.
